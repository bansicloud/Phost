# Phost

The lightweight blogging framework for telling your story.

## Requirements

The software requirements to run Phost are ***a minimum version of PHP 5.6*** although 7.0 and above is preferred. You'll also need to be running MySQL 5.6 or higher on an Apache server. Other software and/or server configurations have no guarantees that they will work. This is an area of the project which will constantly be reviewed and updated when and where necessary.

## Installation

Once you have an environment created where Phost is ready to be installed, navigate to the root of the application and the installation process will begin. This shouldn't take you any longer than one minute to complete and will require you to have a database ready to connection with. Once installed, you'll be taken to your blog's home page where you can get started.

## Support

In the event that you're struggling with using the software, please create a new issue on GitHub. Please do remember that no one is obligated to provide any support and in the event that support is provided, make sure you appreciate the time that person has taken to assist you. There are currently no official support channels as of yet. Stay tuned.
