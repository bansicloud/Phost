# Phost

The lightweight blogging framework for telling your story.

## Requirements

The software requirements to run Phost are a minimum version of PHP 5.6 although 7.0 and above is preferred. You'll also need to be running MySQL 5.6 or higher and an Apache server is highly recommened. Other software and/or server configurations have no guarantees that they will works. This is an area of the project which will constantly be reviewed and updated where necessary.

## Installation

Once you have an environment created where Phost is ready to be installed, navigate to the root of the application and the installation process will begin. This shouldn't take you any longer than one minute to complete and will require you to have a database ready for connections. Once installed, you'll be taken to your blog's home page where you can get started.
